# SET08803 Software Engineering Methods

The following link introduces many of the concepts needed to set up a suitable learning environment for everyone in the module

[Introduction to the Module](units/unit00/Introduction.md) 

In the first week we will be setting up teams to work jointly on the coursework. We will be using ideas from Scrum; a project management and group working philosophy widely adopted in the Software Engineering Community
